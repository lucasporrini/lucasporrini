It's me, Lucas Porrini. You've probably never heard of me. And I've never thought of writing a REAEDME.md for myself. Usually READMEs are writing for application and software. I'm not an application. And I'm not a software too. So this README is about me, I hope you'll enjoy to discover me by reading it.

## About me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a project involving video calls and a payment process to enable people in specific professions to interact in a new way
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Linux, web security and server configuration to be able to host my own sites and databases
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on web projects with companies to provide them with personality solutions that correspond exactly to their needs
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help to integrate Typescript into my projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about  php, conception, databases, use cases and natives web langages
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a bit stubborn
