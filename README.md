<i>I am from Earth!</i>
<p></p>
<p>It's me, Lucas Porrini. You've probably never heard of me. And I've never thought of writing a REAEDME.md for myself. Usually READMEs are writing for application and software. I'm not an application. And I'm not a software too. So this README is about me, I hope you'll enjoy to discover me by reading it.</p>
